# Webhooks

As the whole communication from Amplience to Hybris works via webhooks, these webhooks need to be configured first in Amplience.

Go to [the DC webhook page](https://content.amplience.net/#!/netelevensandbox/development/webhooks) and create the following webhooks:
* [SAP CX update](webhooks/update.md)
* [SAP CX publish](webhooks/publish.md)
* [SAP CX edition](webhooks/edition.md)
* [SAP CX delete](webhooks/delete.md)
